# Container-native Virtualization (CNV) Red Hat Summit Demo 2018

This repository contains a setup which is pretty close to the demo seen at Red
Hat Summit 2018.

This includes the eventually modified components:

- KubeVirt
- Client tools
- VM Template
- OpenShift Web Console

This does not include:

- CDI - Due to issues to deploy it robust in a generic setup
  [This script](https://github.com/aglitke/oc-kubevirt-up) also sets up the CDI, but is not as robust.

# Requirements

- [OpenShift Client Tool v3.9.0](https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v3.9.0) installed
- [`oc cluster up` configured](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md)
- [`virtctl` v0.4.1](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/releases/tag/v0.4.1)
  installed

# Usage

> **Note:** Take a look at the `.logs` file in case of an error

The `oc-kubevirt` script does all necessary steps:
