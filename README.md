# Container-native Virtualization (CNV) Red Hat Summit Demo 2018

This repository contains a setup which is pretty close to the demo seen at Red
Hat Summit 2018.

This includes the eventually modified components:

- KubeVirt
- Client tools
- VM Template
- OpenShift Web Console

This does not include:

- CDI - Due to issues to deploy it robust in a generic setup
  [This script](https://github.com/aglitke/oc-kubevirt-up) also sets up the CDI, but is not as robust.
- Metrics - Unstable to deploy

# Requirements

- [OpenShift Client Tool v3.9.0](https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v3.9.0) installed
- [`oc cluster up` configured](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md)
- [`virtctl` v0.4.1](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/releases/tag/v0.4.1)
  installed

# Usage

> **Note:** Take a look at the `.logs` file in case of an error or use
> `tail -f .logs` during deployment to view the status.

> **Note:** The required setup time is heavily depending on the speed of your
> internet connection.

The `oc-kubevirt` script does all necessary steps, you can pass the `-v` flag
to see all the relevant calls done to perform the setup.

```bash
$ ./oc-kubevirt

INFO For CNV: Log into the web console as 'developer' and go to https://127.0.0.1:8443/console/project/myproject/overview
$
```

> **Note:** Once setup, the virtual machines and templates are accessible in
> the project
> [_My Project_](https://127.0.0.1:8443/console/project/myproject/overview)

## User Guide

Once started, thre is the [KubeVirt user guide](http://docs.kubevirt.io/) to
work with the new entities.

## Cleanup

> **Note:** This will remove all `oc cluster` related data.

The setup can be cleaned using:

```bash
$ ./oc-cluster clean
```
